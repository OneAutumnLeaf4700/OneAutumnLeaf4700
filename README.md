# 👋 Hello, I'm Rayyan!
I’m a penultimate-year Computer Science undergraduate at Queen Mary University of London (‘27) with a focus on software engineering and cybersecurity.

I like building tools that solve real problems I run into — if I catch myself doing something inefficiently, I usually end up coding a fix. My projects range from secure file transfer systems and memory manipulation sandboxes to experiments in AI assistants and blockchain applications.

Right now, I’m learning more about low-level systems programming, security, and scalable software design. My long-term goal is to build a fully-fledged JARVIS-style assistant that integrates with daily life — not just another chatbot, but something that interacts with your workspace, smart devices, and environment.

📌 Pinned projects are a good place to start if you want to see what I’ve been working on.
💬 Always open to feedback, collaboration, or just chatting about code — feel free to reach out.
